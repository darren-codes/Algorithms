sort(a,b);      [a,b)
a is iterator(pointer) to initial element.
b is iterator(pointer) to final+1 element.(as last element isn't included)

sorts by default in ascending order.



or
create user defined bool function;

bool f_n(para1,para2){ //parameters being compared
return //condition//;
}
then

sort(a,b,f_n);//f_n without parenthesis
